Title: Lab D - Driving in Shapes

Author: [PLACEHOLDER] << [Write your name or team name here]

Purpose: Create a script to enable semi-autonomous driving for the RACECAR. Button presses
enable a series of instructions sent to the RACECAR, which enable it to drive in various shapes.
Complete the lines of code under the #TODO indicators to complete the lab.

Expected Outcome: When the user runs the script, they are able to control the RACECAR
using the following keys:
- When the "A" button is pressed, drive in a circle
- When the "B" button is pressed, drive in a square
- When the "X" button is pressed, drive in a figure eight
- When the "Y" button is pressed, drive in any shape of your choice
